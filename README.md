# Data_Analytics_App

## Overview
This project is a Data Analytics application that involves building, testing, and deploying an application using Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. The application performs data analysis and provides results through a Flask web server. The project also includes CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:

- `src/`                  - Source code for the application
- `tests/`                - Unit tests for the application
- `Dockerfile`            - Dockerfile for containerizing the application
- `Jenkinsfile`           - Jenkinsfile for CI/CD pipeline
- `kubernetes/`           - Kubernetes manifests for deployment
- `ansible/`              - Ansible scripts for configuration management (if used)
- `requirements.txt`      - Python dependencies
- `README.md`             - This file
- `.gitignore`            - Git ignore file
